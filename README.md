--------STAR WARS QUIZ GAME----------

-----------The Dark Quiz-------------


This is the first attempt to do a JavaScript application using the new concepts learned during class and some sound files.

The idea is to:
- Manipulate the DOM with some event listeners.
- Update some of the CSS rendering by implementing the use of addClass() and removeClass() methods.
- Make use of some conditionals and variables.
- Use arrays and objects to store the quiz information.


The functionality is as follows:

- The app is a quiz game where the user is asked questions about the Star Wars universe.

- The screen should present 1 question along with 4 answers/options in a form of buttons

- There is a time limit of 1 minute

- Sound alerts should be played according to the option selected for every question

- If 2 answers in a row are wrong, there's a special audio alert by Yoda.

- A special alarm sound is played when the time left is only 10 seconds.

- When the countdown is over, the screen shows a numeric result, a sound and a paragraph according to the number of correct answers.


May the Force be with you!...............(and me)
